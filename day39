#Remove Nth node from End of list
#Two pointers
class Solution(object):
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head, n):
        """
        :type head: Optional[ListNode]
        :type n: int
        :rtype: Optional[ListNode]
        """
        # Step 1: Initialize dummy node to handle edge cases smoothly
        dummy = ListNode(0, head)

        # Step 2: Set both pointers at dummy
        fast = dummy
        slow = dummy

        # Step 3: Move fast pointer n + 1 steps ahead
        for _ in range(n + 1):
            fast = fast.next

        # Step 4: Move both pointers until fast reaches the end
        while fast:
            fast = fast.next
            slow = slow.next

        # Step 5: Delete the target node
        slow.next = slow.next.next

        # Step 6: Return the new head
        return dummy.next

Another way to solve this is finding n using while loop and increasing curr till (n - N) using for loop.
