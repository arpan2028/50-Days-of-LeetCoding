#Same Tree
class Solution:
    def isSameTree(self, p, q):
        if not p and not q:
            return True
        if not p or not q:
            return False
        if p.val != q.val:
            return False
        return self.isSameTree(p.left, q.left) and self.isSameTree(p.right, q.right)





"""
UMPIRE Method
Understand - Same is they are structurally identical and have same value
    Edge Cases - 0 element, 1 element

Match - dfs
Planning -  Recursive dfs
Implement - Recursive dfs
Reviewing - Code looks good
Evaluate - on and oh

"""

There are two more ways to solve this
      1. Iterative BFS using stack
      2. BFS using Queue
I might see them later on.
